## Membership Status Review Criteria

*(ratified by the Collaboration Council, December 2025)*

During Membership Status Review the following criteria and resulting changes of membership status will be applied:

* Those who have updated their DESC member database entry  in the six months preceding the start of the Membership Review have successfully completed the DESC Membership Review for this year and do not need to take further action. This includes new members that have joined the DESC in the past 6 months.

* A DESC Provisional Member or a DESC Member who is not a Full Member and has not responded to the Membership Status Review by the end of the review period will lose their DESC Membership status, including the corresponding rights and privileges. They may rejoin DESC through the standard DESC membership application process.

* A DESC Full Member who has not responded to the Membership Status Review by the end of the review period will lose their DESC Full Membership status, including the corresponding rights and privileges. They will retain their DESC Membership, and will be treated as a Member in the next review period unless they reinstate their Full Membership. Their Full Membership can be reinstated within one year of the date of loss by simply notifying the Membership Committee that they wish to re-engage. Beyond one year, they will need to reapply for Full Membership through the standard Full Membership application process.
