## Membership Status Review Procedure

In preparation for the 2026 DESC Membership Status Review, below is a full outline of the procedure the Membership Committee (MC) will follow.

* MC will announce the DESC Membership Review 2026 Procedure via Slack and the lsst-desc-members mailing list in mid-January, 2026.
* All DESC members who have updated their DESC Membership Database entry or joined the DESC in the past six months (since July 26, 2025) are exempt from this year’s Membership Review.
* The 2026 Membership Review will commence on Tuesday, January 27, 2026.
* MC will send email to all DESC members using their primary email addresses stored in the[ DESC People Database](https://srs.slac.stanford.edu/GroupManager/exp/LSST-DESC/protected/contactList.jsp).
* The text will clearly announce the deadline for responding to the 2026 Membership Review. The deadline is Wednesday, March 11, 2026, 11 PM Pacific Time.
* The text will include instructions for those unable to log into their Confluence account to access their[ DESC People Database](https://srs.slac.stanford.edu/GroupManager/exp/LSST-DESC/protected/contactList.jsp) entry, which is required to participate in the review process.
    * The text will also include instructions to contact the MC if they wish to leave the DESC.
    * The text will include a personalized link to the DESC member's database entry.
    * The sender of the email will be _heather at slac dot stanford dot edu_
        * DESC members are asked to whitelist this email address to avoid missing the Membership Review 2025/2026 email.
* DESC members will receive the email and will:
    * Visit their individualized link
        * Check their database information
            * If all looks correct, click **Update**
            * If changes are necessary
                * make the modifications
                * click **Update**
                * click **Done Editing**
             * Once **Update** is clicked, the DESC member’s **lastCheckedByUser** entry will be set to the current date.
    * If due to personal or technical reasons, the DESC member cannot complete the 2026 Membership Review process, the MC will provide reasonable accommodations.
    * If the DESC member desires to leave the DESC, they can fill out this [Google form](https://forms.gle/ha7uUodabmP3VApQA) or reach out to the MC by sending email to lsst-desc-mc at slac dot stanford dot edu
        * The MC will forward these requests to the lsst-desc-ops-mgmt at slac dot stanford dot edu and request the member be set inactive in the [DESC People Database](https://srs.slac.stanford.edu/GroupManager/exp/LSST-DESC/protected/contactList.jsp).
* The MC will be using the **lastCheckedByUser** dates set for each DESC member, to determine who has and has not responded
* For those DESC members that fail to respond, at least 2 email reminders will be sent.
    * For junior DESC members - the MC will contact advisors as well.
* Those DESC Members that fail to respond or reach out to the MC by the Membership Review deadline, will have their membership modified according to the[ Membership Review Criteria](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/member-db/wiki/Membership-Status-Review-Criteria) and will receive a final email notification.
